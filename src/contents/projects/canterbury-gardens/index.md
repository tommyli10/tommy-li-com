Canterbury Gardens was popular holiday gift shop in Escondido, California. I worked to manage and develop the brick-and-mortar store's local website and online eCommerce store, YourChristmasStore.  

I operated a database of 10,000+ SKUs, writing scripts in SQL, Python, and Microsoft Excel to automate backups and syncing inventories between the POS and website database. I also helped migrate the site from Magento 1 to WordPress/WooCommerce, developing an new custom theme and doing technical and eCommerce SEO.
