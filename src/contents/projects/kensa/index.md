Kensa equips developers with the metrics and tools necessary to monitor and test their GraphQL requests, always ensuring the health and performance of their server. After simply installing the NPM package and visiting the Kensats.link web app, developers can analyze metrics on high latency queries, track response data/errors, and view historical logs of recently made or saved queries.
